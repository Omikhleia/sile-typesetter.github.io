This a normal paragraph: \lorem[words=18]

\dropcap[lines=2]{T}his paragraph has a pretty plain initial (drop cap),
using the default document font:
\lorem[words=26].\footnote{You didnâ€™t expect more than that here, with such a font choice, right?}

\dropcap[lines=3,family=Acorn Initials]{T}\font[features=+smcp]{his paragraph},
provided you have the Acorn Initials font, has a much better initial: \lorem[words=44].

\dropcap[lines=4,family=Zallman Caps]{H}\font[features=+smcp]{ere is an even nicer initial},
provided you have the Zallman Caps font: \lorem[words=56].

\dropcap[lines=4,joined=true,family=Zallman Caps]{T}his paragraph shows the effect of the joining option that you can use when the initial belongs to the first word in a sentence.
The first line of text will be flush against the drop cap.
Each additional line spanned with be indented with an extra space.
In old-style typography, this was often preferred to the bare rectangular box most modern word-processing software render.
With SILE, the choice is all yours!
