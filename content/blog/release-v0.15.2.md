Version v0.15.2 of SILE has been released and is [available for download][release]!
See the included [CHANGELOG.md][changelog] or review the [commit history][commits] for more explicit details.

### Summary of Improvements

The big [v0.15.0 release][v0.15.0] had some rough edges.
But we mentioned that in the [v0.15.1 release notes][v0.15.1] already.
The truth is we fumbled some of the sources in the source tarball again.
Here is to being able to build cleanly from the source tarball again.

### Bug Fixes

* **build:** Bundle all assets in source distribution ([5198641](https://github.com/sile-typesetter/sile/commit/5198641080d929a9240853e8322bf4ba36104cd9))
