Version v0.10.6 of SILE has been released and is [available for download][release]!
See the included [CHANGELOG.md][changelog] or review the [commit history][commits] for more explicit details.

### Summary of Improvements

Most of the changes in this maintenance release are related to the build and packaging system, with a notable exception of the manual. Many more packages have been documented and the manual has seen quite a bit of copy-editing. For users of the *docbook* class, the default monospace font has changed from Dejavu Sans to Hack.

One new feature added to the TeXlike input language now allows single quotes to be escaped (`\"`) to appear in the value of options passed to a command.

In the installation department, two new option flags for `./configure` have been added, `--with-manual` and `--with-examples`. Both are off by default. Enabling these flags will cause a copy of the manual and examples respectively to be installed to your system's `$docsdir`. These PDFs are included pre-built in the source package, but not installed anywhere by default.
