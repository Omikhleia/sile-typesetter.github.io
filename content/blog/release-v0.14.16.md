Version v0.14.16 of SILE has been released and is [available for download][release]!
See the included [CHANGELOG.md][changelog] or review the [commit history][commits] for more explicit details.

### Summary of Improvements

If goofed up some of the merges involved in the release process for v0.14.15.
This doesn't bring any user facing features or fixes, only a bit of refactoring intended to be in the last release.
The main purpose is to straighten out the repository so the expected branch contains the release tags.
Sorry for the noise.


### Bug Fixes

* **tooling:** Re-merge so release tag is on master branch ([e8eaf11](https://github.com/sile-typesetter/sile/commit/e8eaf11da6cd183168898eca08f6f789f46d599e))
