Version v0.10.7 of SILE has been released and is [available for download][release]!
See the included [CHANGELOG.md][changelog] or review the [commit history][commits] for more explicit details.

### Summary of Improvements

This release is substantially the same as v0.10.6, except the release packages were published fully automatically. This was supposed to happen in the last release too, but some issues just don't surface until you do the real thing. This time it actually worked.


### Bug Fixes

* **build:** Merge Github Actions release step with build ([b2d77ab](https://github.com/sile-typesetter/sile/commit/b2d77ab05da064d0a51aa6b8ee85e90ddeb0b63b))
