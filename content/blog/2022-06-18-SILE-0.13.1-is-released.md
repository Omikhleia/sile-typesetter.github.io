### Summary of Improvements

Hot on the heals of a major release we have small one to patch up some odds and ends.
Thanks to [Fredrick Brennan](http://github.com/ctrlcctrlv) for correcting my oversight in not distributing some of the new localization files.
If by chance you've on a new fangled hardware platform like RISC-V things should build out of the box now.
The documentation for installation on various systems has also been cleaned up.
Thanks to [Didier Willis](http://github.com/Omikhleia) for some new rule functions and fixes to old ones plus leader alignment corrections.
